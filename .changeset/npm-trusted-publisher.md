Enable npm trusted publisher with provenance. Sets `publishConfig.provenance: true` so `changeset publish` includes an attestation linking each published version to the GitHub Actions run that produced it. Removes the need for a long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret — the workflow already has `id-token: write` and the package is configured with a trusted publisher on npmjs.com.
