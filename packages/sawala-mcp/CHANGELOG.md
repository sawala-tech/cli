# @sawala/mcp

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 201a5c4: Ship the missing READMEs.

  The first releases of `@sawala/cli@0.1.0` and `@sawala/mcp@0.1.0`
  declared `README.md` in their `files` array but had no such file in the
  package, so the published tarballs contained only `package.json` + `dist/`.
  This patch adds the actual README documents and re-publishes both
  packages so the npmjs.com listings show proper documentation.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b68d301: Introduce the new `sawala` umbrella CLI and `sawala-mcp` MCP server (M0–M3).

  **New packages**

  - `@sawala/cli` — new `sawala` binary combining all core Sawala products under one entry. Read-only surfaces for Kontena (schemas + entries), Formulir (forms + submissions), and Berkasna (assets metadata), plus shared `login`/`logout`/`whoami`/`org`/`project` commands. Credentials live at `~/.sawala/credentials` so it can coexist with the existing `kodena` CLI's `~/.kodena/credentials`.
  - `@sawala/mcp` — new `sawala-mcp` MCP server with 11 read-only tools: `sawala_whoami`, plus `sawala_kontena_*` (4), `sawala_formulir_*` (4), and `sawala_berkasna_*` (2). All tools are marked `readOnlyHint: true` so MCP hosts can auto-allow them.

  **Kodena patch**

  - `@sawala/kodena` and `@sawala/kodena-mcp` had their internal `lib/{paths,api-base,credentials,config,resolve,api}.ts` refactored to delegate to a new private `@sawala/auth` workspace lib that the new `sawala` binary also uses. The public API and on-disk format are byte-identical to the previous release; the change is purely internal. esbuild bundles the auth code into each CLI's `dist`, so the published artifacts have no new runtime dependencies.
